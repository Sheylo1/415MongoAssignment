# MongoRender
Code for testing Mongo DB by deploying to Render. Needs DB access keys. It can be used to deploy a working app but it cannot access a Mongo DB without proper keys.
The (alternative) MongoTest repository is an exact copy of this but with access keys so that it can be used to deploy a working app which can access a Mongo DB.
